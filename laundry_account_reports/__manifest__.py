    'description': """
Adds an **Aged Receivable (Detailed)** report to Accounting > Reporting, next to
the standard Aged Receivable, which is left exactly as Odoo ships it.

It ages day by day for the first five days overdue (then 6-30 / 31-60 / 61-120 /
121-360 / 360+) and shows, on every open line, the POS order or invoice it came
from - date, number, laundry service type, cashier, delivery rider and the
manager who approved Customer Account on it - plus the customer's address and
phone. Those last two sit on the customer rows on screen
and repeat on every order row when the report is exported, so a spreadsheet row
stands on its own.

To make that possible it also stores a link from each receivable move line back
to its POS order (account.move.line.pos_order_id), which core does not record
for orders paid on Customer Account.

The filter bar gains a Service Type filter (tick as many types as you like, plus
a "(No service type)" entry for invoices raised outside the POS), an Account
Approved By filter built the same way (with a "(No approver)" entry), and an
Address filter with a "contains" / "does not contain" text box, and every column
can be dragged wider or narrower (double-click a handle to reset).
