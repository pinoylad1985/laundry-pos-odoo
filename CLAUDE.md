# Laundry POS — Claude Code Project Context

## What This Project Is
A custom Odoo 19 Enterprise module (`laundry_pos`) for **laundryx** that adds a laundry-specific
workflow to the Point of Sale (POS). It is self-hosted on a single VPS via **Docker Compose** (production + staging — see below).

> **Full feature/technical reference:** [docs/laundry-pos-customizations.html](docs/laundry-pos-customizations.html)
> documents every customization in detail. End-user guide: [docs/laundry-pos-module-guide.html](docs/laundry-pos-module-guide.html).
> Keep those in sync when behavior changes.

## Deployment
Self-hosted on a single VPS via **Docker Compose** (Odoo 19 + Postgres + Caddy reverse proxy with HTTPS),
fronted by Cloudflare.
- **Production** — `main` branch → `odoo.laundryx.app` (database `laundryx`).
- **Staging** — `staging` branch → `staging.laundryx.app` (database `laundryx_staging`).

Promotion flow: work → push to `staging` → it deploys to staging → test → open a PR to merge `staging` → `main`
→ run the production deploy (backs up first, pulls `main`, restarts, upgrades the module). After a deploy, in
Odoo: **Apps → Update Apps List → Upgrade Laundry POS**.

- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/pinoylad1985/laundry-pos-odoo
- **Odoo version:** 19 (Enterprise) · **Python:** 3.13 · **Frontend:** OWL 2

> **No `product_template.py` and no product views.** The old "Laundry Services tab" / `laundry_service_type_ids`
> M2M / `productsToDisplay` filtering were **removed**. Products are now recognised by NAME (Wash-Dry-Fold,
> Dry/Wet Clean, Shoe Clean, Press) via `LAUNDRY_MENU`.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **No `_load_pos_data_fields` override on `pos.order`** — its default returns `[]` (read ALL fields), so our
  selection fields load automatically. Overriding it to a specific list would drop lines/partner/amounts.
- **Order fields are computed-stored, NOT `related`** — a stored `related` is writable and would push values back to
  `res.partner` (POS could wipe the customer's phone on sync). Computed = one-way (partner → order).
- **`addNewOrder` stays synchronous** — it's called 10+ places without `await`; async leaves `order.uuid` undefined
  before navigation → `/product/undefined` crash. We set `order._needsLaundrySetup` and let ProductScreen react.
- **Products matched by NAME, not IDs/tags** — survives DB restores and re-seeding; no per-product config needed.
- **localStorage for laundry meta** — the `laundry_*` JS fields aren't server-synced, so they're rehydrated across reloads.
- **Turnaround (TAT) is computed from the schedule and locked** — not a free cashier choice; keeps lines/receipt consistent.
- **Configurator crash guard** — `initAttributes()` pre-seeds `state.attributes` for every value's `attribute_id` so
  malformed products (e.g. after a DB restore) don't crash the popup.

## Service Types (seeded data + frontend list)
| Code | Label |
|------|-------|
| `dropoff` | Drop-off |
| `dropoff_delivery` | Drop-off & Delivery |
| `pickup_delivery` | Pickup & Delivery |
| `locker` | Locker |
| `self_service` | Self-service |

## Service Products (matched by name)
| Code | Name contains | Quantity behavior |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| `wdf` | Wash-Dry-Fold | per-KG, editable; min weight at payment (6kg single / 4kg each multi) |
| `dwc` | Dry/Wet Clean | locked to 1; long turnaround |
| `shoe` | Shoe Clean | locked to 1; long turnaround |
| `press` | Press | may exceed 1 |

## Important Files NOT to Break
- `models/pos_order.py` — do NOT add `_load_pos_data_fields`; keep order fields computed (not related).
- `static/src/overrides/pos_store.js` — `addNewOrder` must stay synchronous.
- `__manifest__.py` — asset glob `laundry_pos/static/src/**/*` picks up all SCSS/JS/XML.

## Odoo 19 POS Architecture Notes
- Popup pattern: `makeAwaitable` from `@point_of_sale/app/utils/make_awaitable_dialog`
- POS store: `@point_of_sale/app/services/pos_store` → `PosStore`
- Product screen: `@point_of_sale/app/screens/product_screen/product_screen`
- Configurator: `@point_of_sale/app/components/popups/product_configurator_popup/product_configurator_popup`
- Cash control: opening/closing popups under `@point_of_sale/app/components/popups/`
- Asset bundle: `point_of_sale._assets_pos` · Models loaded via `_load_pos_data_fields` + `_load_pos_data_read`
- OWL: `patch(Class.prototype, {...})`, `useEffect(effect, () => [deps])`, `super.method(...arguments)`
